app.description=The only arcade game I ever wrote while growing up in Germany.
app.description=You can clearly tell that
app.description=the splash screen was heavily inspired by the Big Five games. Take a note
app.description=of the zip code in the screenshot. Back in 1982 Germany had four-digit zip
app.description=codes (after reunification of Germany five-digit zip codes were introduced).
app.description=Note that the game relies on the cursor keys being on the left and right
app.description=side of the keyboard. Unless you are using a physical keyboard, this
app.description=game can only be played with a game controller.
