app.description=This time we got permission first. Sega gave us a license for the game ZAXXON
app.description=and then we wrote this. By this time, Tandy/Radio Shack had started accepting
app.description=third party programs for sale in their stores and so we struck a deal with them
app.description=instead of Adventure International. However manufacturing problems on our
app.description=end limited the distribution.
app.description=Use the arrow keys to move and SPACE BAR to fire. The game can be stopped by
app.description=hitting SHIFT+S, and restarted by then hitting ENTER. SHIFT+BREAK aborts
app.description=the game.
