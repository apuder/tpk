app.description=Armored Patrol is a different version of our first game, a version of the
app.description=old coin-op game BATTLEZONE. The original was called Tank Zone 2000 (I hate
app.description=that name!). We submitted it to Scott Adams' company Adventure International
app.description=whose marketing droids made us change the pyramids to houses, the flying
app.description=saucer to a robot and the name to Armored Patrol.
