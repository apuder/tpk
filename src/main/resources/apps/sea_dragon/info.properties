app.description=This game was our original idea, based on a suggestion
app.description=from my Dad after he saw the game SCRAMBLE, however we borrowed
app.description=the ending from the game PHOENIX. This game is without a doubt
app.description=our favorite.
app.description=Use the arrow keys to move and SPACE BAR to fire. The ENTER key shoots
app.description=vertical missiles. The game can be stopped by hitting SHIFT+S, and
app.description=restarted by then hitting ENTER. SHIFT+BREAK aborts the game.
